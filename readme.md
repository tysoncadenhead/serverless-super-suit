# Serverless Super Suit

This is a work in progress. The idea is to create an environment where running local serverless infrastructure is made easier by a little abstraction and some adapters that emulate things like SQS, SNS, EventBridge, ApiGateway and AppSync. The question to be answered is whether a pluggable serverless local environment can be achieved that gives better type guarantees about what will happen once a stack is deployed.
